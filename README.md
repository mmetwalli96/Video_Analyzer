# Video Analysis Project

## Project Overview:

Nowadays, the presence of video surveillance cameras is pervasive and there are many unauthorized or unlawful activities that are not being informed or known to the authorities due to the lack of presence of law enforcement. To address this, this projectâ€™s aim is to utilize computer vision algorithms in capturing these events and sending a notification to report them.
